        The Shinning

        The Shining is set in Colorado in the 1970s. It centres on the Torrance family: husband Jack, wife Wendy, and their five-year-old son, Danny. 
        At the beginning of the novel, Jack is hired as the caretaker of the remote Overlook Hotel for the winter offseason. He is informed by the hotel 
        manager that the previous caretaker, Delbert Grady, killed his entire family inside the hotel. Specifically, Grady “murdered the little girls with a 
        hatchet, his wife with a shotgun, and himself the same way.” As Jack later learns, the Overlook has a long and ghastly history. Over the years, it has 
        housed illicit affairs, horrible murders, and mob-style executions; perhaps by consequence, its ownership has changed hands several times.Jack is nonetheless 
        determined to be the caretaker. In the past, Jack—an aspirant writer and former prep-school teacher—struggled with alcoholism and anger issues; once, he 
        accidentally broke his son’s arm while trying to discipline him. More recently, Jack assaulted a teenage student who let the air out of his tires. The incident 
        cost Jack his teaching job and compelled his wife, Wendy, to strongly consider a divorce. Now Jack is a recovering alcoholic. His ties to his family are weak, 
        and his play—a long-stalled work-in-progress—remains largely unfinished. Jack hopes that the seclusion of the Overlook will help him finish the play and reconnect 
        with his wife and son.

        On the day of their arrival, the Torrances are given a tour of the Overlook by the hotel manager. They are introduced to Dick Hallorann, 
        the hotel cook, who takes a special interest in Danny. Unlike his parents, Danny is remarkably perceptive and supernaturally gifted; he 
        has extrasensory abilities that allow him to read minds, communicate telepathically, and see past and possible future events. As he tells 
        Hallorann, he is sometimes visited by a shadowy, ethereal figure whom he calls “Tony.” Hallorann explains that he has powers similar 
        to Danny’s; he calls them “the shining.” Hallorann not only helps Danny understand his powers but also tells him, “If there is trouble…you 
        give a call.” Hallorann then leaves for St. Petersburg, Florida, where he spends his winters. Shortly thereafter, the remaining staff and guests 
        depart, leaving the Torrance family alone in the Overlook.The longer the Torrances stay at the Overlook, the more haunting and powerful it becomes. 
        While inside the hotel, Danny is plagued by disturbing visions and apparitions: “REDRUM” (“MURDER” spelled backward) appears in several contexts, 
        gruesome figures materialize in strange places, a fire hose chases him down a hallway, and so on. For a long time, Danny refuses to tell either parent 
        about what he has seen. Still, Wendy perceives that something is wrong with Danny. She thinks about removing herself and her son from the hotel, leaving 
        Jack to finish the job alone, but ultimately decides against it. Not long after, a heavy snowfall all but cuts the Torrances off from the outside world.

        During this time, the Overlook begins trying to possess Jack. It entices him with historical records and a mysterious scrapbook documenting the exploits 
        of its guests. Eventually, it convinces Jack to destroy his two-way CB radio and disable the hotel snowmobile. The Overlook thereby eliminates the family’s 
        only remaining links to the outside world. Although unaware of the hotel’s power over her husband, Wendy grows increasingly distrustful of Jack. After a corpse 
        tries to strangle Danny in the infamous room 217 and Wendy and Jack see the resulting bruise on their son’s neck, Wendy accuses Jack of abusing Danny. On the morning 
        of December 2, Jack wanders into the hotel ballroom. To his surprise, he finds the bar stocked with liquor and tended by a bartender named Lloyd. While Lloyd pours 
        Jack martini after martini, a ghostly party—a 1945 masquerade ball—rages on in the ballroom. After several drinks, Jack is confronted by the ghost of Delbert Grady, 
        the caretaker who murdered his family. Grady urges Jack to “correct” his wife and son. In his drunken, enraged state, Jack agrees. That afternoon he attempts to strangle 
        Wendy in the barroom. Wendy’s fingertips graze a glass bottle, which she uses to hit Jack over the head and escape his grip. Together, she and Danny drag Jack’s unconscious 
        body to a walk-in pantry and lock him inside.

        A few hours later, Grady confronts Jack in the pantry. After making him promise to kill Wendy and bring his son to “us,” presumably the evil spirits of the Overlook, 
        Grady unlocks the pantry, releasing Jack. Again, Jack attacks Wendy, this time with one of the hotel’s roque mallets, savagely injuring her. Although she stabs him in 
        the lower back with a kitchen knife, Jack’s attacks do not cease. Unable to walk, Wendy drags herself up the grand stairs and locks herself in her bathroom. Jack follows 
        closely behind and, upon finding the bathroom door locked, attempts to break the door down with the mallet. When he thrusts his hand through the resulting hole in the door, 
        Wendy slashes it with a razor blade. Meanwhile, Hallorann receives a psychic call for help from Danny. He rushes back to the Overlook, where he is attacked by its hedge animals, 
        which, like the rest of the hotel, have come to life. Hallorann manages to make it inside the Overlook only to be gravely injured by Jack, who apparently overheard the approach 
        of his snowmobile. With both Wendy and her would-be rescuer out of the way, Jack pursues Danny. Unbeknownst to Jack, Danny is wandering the hallways of the hotel, following Tony’s 
        voice. Tony appears to Danny and tells him, “Danny…you’re in a place deep down in your own mind. The place where I am. I’m a part of you, Danny.” As it turns out, Tony is an older 
        version of Danny; he comes to warn his younger self about forthcoming events.

     After some searching, Jack corners Danny on the third floor. Danny observes the creature that his father has become. He reminds himself “it was not his daddy, not this Saturday Night 
    Shock Show horror with its rolling eyes and hunched and hulking shoulders and blood-drenched shirt.” Despite Jack’s menacing threats, Danny stands his ground. He denounces Jack as a 
    “mask”—a “false face” worn by the hotel. For a moment, Jack recovers control of his body, and he tells his son that he must run. The hotel then takes full control of Jack.

        Suddenly, Danny remembers what his father forgot: the Overlook’s old, unstable boiler has not been checked for days. He announces his discovery to the hotel-creature, 
        causing it to panic and take off for the basement. In its absence, Danny finds Wendy and Hallorann, and, together, they flee the hotel. Seconds after they make their exit, 
        the boiler explodes. The hotel-creature is instantly killed, and the Overlook gradually succumbs to the fire. The surviving party—Hallorann, Wendy, and Danny—ride away on a 
        snowmobile.

        A short epilogue (set in the summer) follows. Hallorann has taken a job in Maine, where Wendy is recovering from her injuries and Danny fishes. Although he misses Jack, 
        Danny accepts Hallorann as a father figure. Hallorann, in turn, assures Danny that he and his mother will be okay. Together with Wendy, Hallorann watches as Danny reels 
        in a rainbow-coloured fish.
